## About hs-logo

_hs-logo_ is written by [Deepak Jois].

[Deepak Jois]: http://deepak.jois.name

The interpreter is written in the [Haskell] programming language, and uses
[diagrams] for describing and rendering images. The author is a relative
newcomer to Haskell, so any suggestions and contributions are welcome. Head over
the to the [github repository for hs-logo][hs-logo] to download the sources.
