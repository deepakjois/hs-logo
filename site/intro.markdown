_hs-logo_ is an interpreter for the [Logo Programming Language][logo], written
in [Haskell]. It is specialised for Turtle graphics, and is not intended to be a
full-fledged Logo interpreter.

Read the [installation guide] , and then browse the [examples] to get
started. You can execute your logo files to generate an image like below. A more
detailed user guide will be added soon.

% hs-logo example.logo -o example.svg

The interpreter is still a work in progress, and more primitives will be added
soon. I also plan to write user guide sometime before the next release. You can
find the sources at the [hs-logo project on github][github].
